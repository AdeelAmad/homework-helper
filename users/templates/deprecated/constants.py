    <h4>Folk and Popular Culture Homework Activity</h4> <br>
    <br>
    <p>Directions: Answer the following questions as completely as possible.
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Describe two activities of popular culture that you engage in. For each activity describe how and why this activity originated or was created. — use the internet if needed
    <br><br>
    I engage in the use of social media and watch TV. Social media was originally created to help people stay in touch over long distances. TV was created for entertainment.
    <br><br>
    2. Describe a personal habit and a custom that you follow that is not generically "popular culture". Be sure to define and explain each one, and then try to explain where each one originated. — use the internet if needed
    <br><br>
    One personal habit or thing that I do is skiing. A lot of people think of skiing and an exotic or strange sport, so it is not popular culture.
    <br><br>
    3. Food for thought: Do you consider your culture to be part of the "dominant" culture at this school? If "yes," explain how you observe other cultures and why you make these observations. If "no," explain how the dominant culture influences your own culture.
    <br><br>
    My culture is not the dominant culture at school, however, the dominant culture doesn’t affect because I am my own person and do as want.

    <h4>Washington Post Map Analysis</h4>
    <br><br>
    1.  What is Graph #1, titled "some continents have more language than` others", showing?
    <br><br>
    Asia and Africa have the most languages while Europe has the least.
    <br><br>
    2. Why do you think there is more linguistic diversity in Asia and Africa than in Europe? 
    <br><br>
    Because there are more countries and people.
    <br><br>
    3. From graph #2, titled "these are some of the languages with the most native speakers", rank the top 12 languages by the number of native speakers: 
    <br><br>
    <ol>
    <li>Chinese</li>
    <li>Hindu-Urdu</li>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>Arabic</li>
    <li>Spanish</li>
    <li>Bengali</li>
    <li>Russian</li>
    <li>Portuguese</li>
    <li>German</li>
    <li>Japanese</li>
    <li>French</li>
    <li>Italian</li>
    </ol>
    3. Look at what map #3 is displaying and make an educated guess as to why some places have more language diversity than other places?
    <br><br>
    They might be primarily composed of immigrants.
    <br><br>
    6. From table #4, why do you think English is spoken in so many countries? 
    <br><br>
    Due to past colonization and the language sticking despite becoming independent.
    <br><br>
    7. From map #5, how many countries is English the official language?
    <br><br>
    35 Countries
    <br><br>
    8. What does map #6 show AND what do you think is the main consequence of the scenarios the map predicts?
    <br><br>
    Less diversity in communication and culture.
    <br><br>
    Experts expect 90% of the world’s approximately 7,000 languages will become extinct in the next 100 years as cultures mesh and isolated tribes die out. Would it just be better if everyone on earth spoke the same language?
    <br><br>
    I think that it would be good because it would eradicate the language barrier.
    <br><br>
    11. How does chart #7 relate to the concept of a “lingua franca” (this can be found in Chapter 5, Key Issue #4, page 172).
    <br><br>
    English is becoming the world’s lingua franca.

    <h4>Religion Webquest Activity</h4>

    
    <ol>
    
    <li>Proportional symbol map
    
    <li>There were 5.8 billion religious adherents in 2010. They represented 84% of the world population of 6.9 billion. This shows that most humans want something supernatural to believe in. This can be fulfilled by following a religion. This number has most likely raised by now.
    
    <li>Top religions: 
    <ol>
     
    <li>Christianity  
    <ol>
      
    <li>32.5%
    </li>  
    </ol>
     
    <li>Islam  
    <ol>
      
    <li>23.2%
    </li>  
    </ol>
     
    <li>Hindus  
    <ol>
      
    <li>15%
    </li>  
    </ol>
    </li>  
    </ol>
    
    <li>1.1 billion or 16.3% have no religious affiliation. Although some of those people believe if spirits or god, they do not associate with a specific faith. I believe that this number will increase in the future do to a multitude of reasons. Some of those reasons include the increasing separation of government and religion.
    
    <li>Hindus, Buddists, Muslims, Folk Religions
    
    <li>Some observations: 
    <ol>
     
    <li>About 75% of all the major religions live in a majority country.
     
    <li>Folk religions are never a majority because they aren’t a majority anywhere.
     
    <li>73% live a majority country.
    </li> 
    </ol>
    
    <li>According to my research, Hindus have the lowest median age. I can attribute this to two reasons. One, Hinduism is dominant in India where children make up a majority of the population. This means that they would become Hindu because their parents are. Second it that the population of India is about 1.1 billion so there are more followers.
    
    <li>Christianity: 
    <ol>
     
    <li>Locations:  
    <ol>
      
    <li>Europe
      
    <li>Latin-America, Carribean
      
    <li>Sub-saharan Africa
      
    <li>Asia Pacific
      
    <li>North America
      
    <li>Middle-East, North-Africa
    </li>  
    </ol>
     
    <li>Interesting Facts:  
    <ol>
      
    <li>I found it interesting that there are more christians in Latin-America than North America
      
    <li>The higher concentration in Sub-Saharan Africa surprised me.
      
    <li>The results were based on self identification, so each numbers definition of Christian may differ.
    </li>  
    </ol>
     
    <li>Question:  
    <ol>
      
    <li>Why are almost all of the Chrisitians in North America in the U.S?
